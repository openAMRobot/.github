## Hi there 👋

# OpenAMR: Affordable Autonomous Mobile Robot

Welcome to OpenAMR! We're a passionate team of robotics enthusiasts based in the Mechatronics Lab of the BHT University in Berlin. Our mission is to democratize robotics technology by sharing comprehensive, open-source resources for building affordable autonomous mobile robots. Whether you’re a small or medium enterprise, an individual entrepreneur, or a specialist, we invite you to join us in creating innovative automation solutions.

## 🚀 Project Aim

OpenAMR provides a detailed guide for building an affordable and versatile autonomous mobile robot. Our robot is designed to:

- **Automate Goods Movement:** Efficiently move goods in warehouses, manufacturing plants, and farms.
- **Enhance Operational Efficiency:** Improve logistics and material transport with advanced navigation and modular design.
- **Be Cost-Effective:** Achieve a preliminary production cost of under €3000.

### Key Features:

- **High Manufacturability:** Designed with simplicity in mind to facilitate easy production with basic technologies.
- **Advanced Navigation:** Utilizes LiDAR SLAM technology for accurate navigation and obstacle avoidance.
- **Modular Design:** Features a customizable platform for various attachments, including conveyors, elevators, and more.
